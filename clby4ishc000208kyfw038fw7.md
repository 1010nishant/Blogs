If you’re looking to improve scalability, reduce overhead costs, and standardize software deployments across multiple machines and platforms, **containers** and **virtual machines (VMs)** are two of the top approaches in use today. They’re not mutually exclusive, either—both can help your IT team become more agile and responsive to business demands. However, the concepts can be confusing. 

So, to distinguish between containers and VMs, we’ve rounded up the basics on each.

**Containerization is one of the substitutes for full machine virtualization.** It employs many isolated services on one platform; on the other hand, Virtualization is the process of designing a version of anything virtual in nature.

## What are virtual machines and virtualization?

**Virtualization is a technology that allows a single physical computer or server to host multiple virtual machines.** These virtual machines, also known as **guest machines**, can run their own operating systems and applications as if they were physical computers.

### benefits to using virtualization:-

1.  **Improved resource utilization:** Virtualization allows multiple virtual machines to share the resources of a single physical machine, which can lead to better utilization of those resources. For example, rather than having several physical servers running at only a tiny percentage of their capacity, a single physical server can host multiple virtual machines that use the resources of the physical server more efficiently.
    
2.  I**ncreased flexibility:** Virtualization makes it easy to create, configure, and manage virtual machines, which can be quickly and easily moved from one physical host to another. This allows organizations to more easily adapt to changing business needs and scale their IT infrastructure as needed.
    
3.  **Improved disaster recovery:** Virtualization makes it easier to back up and restore virtual machines, which can be useful for disaster recovery purposes. If a physical server fails, the virtual machines running on it can be quickly restored to another physical server.
    
4.  **Enhanced security:** Virtualization can help improve security by allowing organizations to isolate different applications and workloads on separate virtual machines. This can help prevent one application or workload from affecting the security or stability of others.
    
5.  **Reduced hardware and maintenance costs:** Virtualization can help reduce hardware and maintenance costs by allowing organizations to consolidate multiple physical servers onto a smaller number of more powerful physical servers. This can also reduce the amount of physical space needed to host the servers, as well as the energy and cooling costs associated with running them.
    

### Disadvantage of using Virtualization:-

There are a few potential **disadvantages to using virtualization:**

1.  **Performance overhead:** Virtualization introduces an additional layer between the hardware and the operating system, which can result in some performance overhead. While this overhead is usually minimal, it can be more significant in resource-intensive workloads or applications that require low latency.
    
2.  **Complexity:** Virtualization can add complexity to an IT environment, as it requires specialized hardware and software, and requires skilled administrators to manage it. This can be particularly challenging for organizations with limited IT resources.
    
3.  **Licensing costs:** Some virtualization software and operating systems require separate licenses for each virtual machine, which can add to the overall cost of implementing and maintaining a virtualized environment.
    
4.  **Security risks:** Virtualization can introduce additional security risks, as virtual machines share the same physical host and may be able to access the same resources. Careful planning and configuration are required to ensure that virtual machines are isolated and secure.
    
5.  **Compatibility issues:** Some applications may not be compatible with virtualization or may not perform as well in a virtualized environment, which can be a disadvantage for organizations that rely on these applications.
    

## What are containers and containerization?

**Containerization** is a technology that allows developers to package and deploy applications in lightweight containers that include everything the application needs to run, including the code, libraries, dependencies, and runtime.

### benefits to using containerization:-

1.  **Portability:** Containers allow developers to package an application and all its dependencies in a single container image, which can be easily moved between different environments, such as development, staging, and production. This makes it easy to deploy and run the application consistently across different environments.
    
2.  **Isolation:** Containers provide isolation between applications, which means that each application runs in its own environment and is isolated from other applications running on the same host. This can help prevent one application from affecting the performance or stability of another.
    
3.  **Efficiency:** Containers are lightweight and use fewer resources than traditional virtual machines, which makes them more efficient and faster to start up. This allows organizations to run more applications on a single host, which can help reduce hardware and infrastructure costs.
    
4.  **Scalability:** Containers are easy to scale up or down as needed, which makes it easy to adjust to changing workloads and scale applications as needed.
    
5.  **Ease of use:** Containerization makes it easy for developers to build, test, and deploy applications, as they can simply create a container image and deploy it to a container runtime. This can help streamline the development and deployment process.
    

### Disadvantage of using Virtualization:-

There are a few potential disadvantages to using containerization:

1.  **Compatibility issues:** Some applications may not be suitable for containerization, either because they are not designed to be run in a containerized environment or because they require access to resources or configurations that are not available in a container.
    
2.  **Security risks:** Containers can introduce additional security risks if they are not properly configured and managed. Containers share the same host and kernel as the host operating system, which means that a vulnerability in the host operating system could potentially affect all the containers running on it.
    
3.  **Complexity:** Containerization can add complexity to an IT environment, as it requires specialized tools and knowledge to build, deploy, and manage containers. This can be particularly challenging for organizations with limited IT resources.
    
4.  **Resource contention:** If multiple containers are running on the same host and competing for resources, this can lead to resource contention and potentially reduced performance.
    
5.  **Limited customization:** Containers are designed to be lightweight and portable, which can limit the amount of customization that is possible. This can be a disadvantage for organizations that require more control over the environment in which their applications are running.
    

## Containerization or virtualization: What’s the right path for you? 

**Virtualization** enables you to run multiple operating systems on the hardware of a single physical server, while **containerization** enables you to deploy multiple applications using the same operating system on a single virtual machine or server.

Virtual machines are great for supporting applications that require an operating system’s full functionality when you want to deploy multiple applications on a server, or when you have a wide variety of operating systems to manage. Containers are a better choice when your biggest priority is to minimize the number of servers you’re using for multiple applications.

Your use case matters too. Containers are an excellent choice for tasks with a much shorter lifecycle. With their fast set-up time, they are suitable for tasks that may only take a few hours. Virtual machines have a longer lifecycle than containers and are best used for longer periods of time.
