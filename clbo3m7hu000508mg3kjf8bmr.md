To get into your dream company, your DSA should be really good. They matter a lot in your day-to-day activities too, they help you develop problem-solving skills.

> # **Practice makes you perfec**t

We have all come across this quote and know its meaning and importance. Whatever we do in our careers to be good at it, we need to keep practicing regularly.

Here is a list of online coding platforms that have various courses as well as set-up questions for you to practice. These platforms have a consistency streak so that you can hold yourself accountable, and daily contests so that you can test where you stand.

So, if you’re looking for free resources to crack an interview for your dream company, this is the right place for you! i have list down 5 free resources to help you get your dream job.

## **1\. LeetCode**

It has one of the best collections of filtered problems for various tech companies. It has very great community support. You can solve the question and then go for `discussion` section as well to see other people’s solutions and how you can improve.

You will see many software developers from **Google**, **Amazon**, and **Facebook** recommend you solve problems on LeetCode.

They also have few contests and competitions running. Still, most of their excellent features are a part of paid premium service

## 2\. **HackerRank**

**Hackerrank** has to be the first platform you should start coding. It has problems in every language you can think of with well-categorized sections. For example, you want to practice only java problems. They have a specialized corner for fundamental conceptual java problems only. Then you wish to solve more complex Data Structures problems; you can check out their problem-solving section.

They also have a certification program where you get certificates in particular domains like Java, Python, and React to solve a problem given by them in a time frame. So, its a good recognition for your work.

One other benefit of Hackerrank is that all the companies, while recruiting, take the first technical round on their platform, so practicing it will make you comfortable.

One site which has helped me improve my problem-solving skills a lot and still helping is GeeksForGeeks, or as often techies call it GFG, is the one of the best portal for Computer Science.

The platform provides you access to all types of training materials, from programming problems to practice for entrance exams, from basic to premium courses, etc. GeeksforGeeks shows an inclusive approach to all technical concepts and several ways to resolve programming problems that enable you to choose the appropriate solution.

As you can see here are lot of topics for data structures and algorithms like array, linked list, stack etc.

you should check it out once.
