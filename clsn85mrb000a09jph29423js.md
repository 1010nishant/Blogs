On the internet, many tutorials teach the same types of projects like YouTube clones, Spotify clones, and to-do lists for learning frontend development.  
The problem is that these projects are too common, and anyone can make or copy them.  
Recruiters and interviewers have seen them a lot, and it doesn't impress them anymore.  
  
If you keep doing these common projects, you won't stand out in the competitive job market.  
Nowadays, you need to be unique and different from others to catch the attention of recruiters and HR. Here, I'll share five JavaScript libraries you can use in your projects to make them awesome and stand out, giving that "wow" factor.  

# **1\.** [**Locomotive Scroll**](https://locomotivemtl.github.io/locomotive-scroll/)**:**

Imagine scrolling through a webpage, and it feels like you're smoothly gliding down a scenic route instead of the usual bumpy ride. That's the magic of a "locomotive scroll." It's like upgrading your scrolling experience from a regular car to a sleek, high-tech train.

With locomotive scroll, the webpage doesn't just jump from one section to another; instead, it gracefully transitions, giving you a smoother and more visually appealing journey. It's as if the content on the webpage is orchestrated to move in harmony, creating a delightful and immersive feeling as you explore the online landscape. So, in simpler terms, it's like turning your scrolling adventure into a first-class train ride through the internet! ðŸš‚âœ¨

# **2\.** [**Three JS**](https://threejs.org/)**:**

Imagine you're an artist, and you want to create stunning 3D artwork to share with the world. But here's the catch: you're not a magician who can make 3D graphics appear out of thin air. That's where Three.js steps in to save the day!

Three.js is like a magical paintbrush for the web. It's a JavaScript library that makes it way easier for regular folks like you and me to bring 3D graphics to life on our websites. Think of it as the bridge between your imagination and the virtual world.

With Three.js, you don't need to be a coding wizard or a 3D expert. It simplifies the complex stuff, allowing you to create mind-blowing 3D scenes, animations, and interactive experiences using just your web browser. It's like a playground for turning your artistic visions into interactive web reality.

# **3\.** [**Framer-motion**](https://www.framer.com/motion/)**:**

# **4\.** [**Bideo JS**](https://rishabhp.github.io/bideo.js/)**:**

Alright, imagine you're creating a website, and you want to make it stand out by having a cool background video that covers the whole screen. Instead of scratching your head about how to do it from scratch, you can use a nifty tool called Bideo.js. It's like a magical helper for your website â€“ a JavaScript library that makes adding these awesome fullscreen background videos a breeze.

With Bideo.js, you don't need to be a coding wizard. It simplifies the process, making it super easy for even beginners to add that wow factor to their websites. So, think of it as your shortcut to making your web project look way more engaging and visually impressive, just by effortlessly incorporating fullscreen background videos. Cool, right?

# **5\.** [**Floating-UI**](https://floating-ui.com/)**(Popper js**[**)**](https://floating-ui.com/)**:**

Imagine you have a helpful little companion that hovers next to something important, always staying close and never getting in the way. This companion is like a floating user interface (UI). It's smart enough to position itself strategically, ensuring it doesn't bump into anything or block your view.

For instance, think of it like a friendly guide that shows up when you need extra information. If you're on a website and want more details about something, this floating UI appears right next to it, like a virtual assistant offering additional tips. It's handy because it's there when you need it, but it won't bother you or cover up what you're trying to see. It's all about being considerate and making sure the information or options are easily accessible without being intrusive.
